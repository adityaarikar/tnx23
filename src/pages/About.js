                    Technex is our flagship Technical event held annually which
                    attracts hundreds of Engineering students from different
                    parts of the country. Technex is an event which is driven
                    and organized by a team of students and mentored by a team
                    of faculties. The event was started in 2007 with the motive
                    of encouraging technology, scientific thinking and
                    innovation among young engineers and giving them a platform
                    to enhance their skills. Currently Technex is recognized as
                    Central Indiaâ€™s largest Science and technology fest with an
                    annual participation of more than 2500+ technology
                    enthusiasts.

                          participants to compete. Thus increasing the level of
                          competition and game play while also increasing the
                          reach of Technex to differnet states. This will allow
                          participants to compete and interact with technocrats
                          from different parts of India. Therefore this year we
                          want to present Technex as an event which will not
                          only be a competition but will also serve as an
                          interaction platform between aspiring engineers from
                          all over India.
